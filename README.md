# DC33 CompuNet Badge - The Meshtastic Express

Introducing **The Meshtastic Express** — the open-source, networkless pager built for hackers, tinkerers, and technophiles. Powered by the Meshtastic protocol and fully customizable from the firmware up, this device lets you send messages over a decentralized mesh network — no cell towers, no Wi-Fi, no problem. Flash your own firmware, tweak the hardware with this highly customizable device and relive the 1990’s glory of belt-clip attached electronics.

Meshtastic devices use **LoRa (Long Range)** radio technology to send small data packets over several kilometers. Each device acts as a node in the mesh, forwarding messages to others until they reach their destination. Learn more at:
